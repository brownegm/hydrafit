# hydrafit

The goal of hydrafit is to fit line parameters using a likelihood frame
work for leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves. The functions included in
the tests of the best fit are linear, logistic, sigmoidal, and two
exponential functions. This package are provides support for the
bootstrapping percent loss in hydraulic function.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hydrafit from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("brownegm/hydrafit")
```

## Example…tbd

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
