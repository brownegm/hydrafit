The goal of hydrafit is to fit line parameters using a likelihood frame
work for leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves. The functions included in
the tests of the best fit are linear, logistic, sigmoidal, and two
exponential functions. This package are provides support for the
bootstrapping percent loss in hydraulic function.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hydrafit from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

devtools::install_github("brownegm/hydrafit", build_vignettes = T)
```

## Example

An example of the use of the functions is available as a vignette.

``` r
