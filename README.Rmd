## Fit hydraulic vulnerability curves and bootstrap hydraulic thresholds

The goal of hydrafit is to fit line parameters using a likelihood frame work for leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves. The functions included in the tests of the best fit are:

-   linear

<!-- -->

-   logistic

-   sigmoidal

-   and two exponential functions

See `?hydrafit::Linear()` for all fitted functions.

This package also supports for the bootstrapping percent loss in hydraulic function as well as pairwise bootstrap comparisons. For more information on bootstrapping see `?hydrafit::bootPX`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hydrafit from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("brownegm/hydrafit", build_vignettes = T)
```

## Examples

An example of the use of the functions is available as a vignette.

```{r eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes(package = "hydrafit")
```

The unrendered vignette is also available in vignettes folder as a .qmd file.
